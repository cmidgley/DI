## Modifications to the original in this fork

This fork has been made to manage changes necessary to use with an embedded JavaScript framework called [ModdableSDK](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable).  There are five main changes:

1) Addition of a [ttypescript](https://github.com/cevek/ttypescript) module to allow for compiling with the command `ttsc` using the required DI transformer.  Also updated `package.json` to use a `postinstall` script to load the required modules.
2) Addition of a `manifest.json` file required by Moddable to control the build.  This file is similar to a `package.json` file used by Node, but has a different format and technique to include files.
3) A change to `di-container.ts` to resolve a typescript error due to a missing cast.
4) Removal of sourcemap references from generated files: At the end of the `dist/...` generated source files are the standard TypeScript references to source maps (`sourceMappingURL`).  Currently there is a [bug](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/issues/771) in Moddable that causes the compiler to fail to compile the code, so these have been removed.  Once that bug is fixed, this change will be reverted.  This change is implemented via a script executed via `npm run remove-maps` command, which requires linux-style operation to work (depends on piping from `find` to `xargs` and `sed`).
5) Remove `dist` from .gitignore so that we check in the hacked dist file.  Will also be removed when the bug is fixed.  This is a bit lazy, as technically we could publish this as a problem NPM package, but seeing as this from a bug, and hopefully once clarified the changes can get pulled into mainline, we are avoiding creating a unique package.

Using this requires hand editing the Moddable `mcconfig.js` file to modify it so it generates the `ttsc` command (or `npx ttsc` if `ttypescript` is not installed globally), and also adds the required `plugins` sections to `tsconfig.json` to reference the transformer module (#3, above).  I have submitted a [feature request](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable/issues/772) to Moddable to propose adding functionality to Moddable to avoid this hack.

The modifications are made to the `.../moddable/tools/mcmanifest.js` file as follows:

* In `generateModulesRules` search for `"tsc"` (currently around line 456/467) and change `tsc` to either `ttsc` (`ttypescript` globally installed) or `npx ttsc` (locally installed):
```tsc
this.echo(tool, "npx ttsc ", "tsconfig.json");
this.line("\tnpx ttsc -p $(MODULES_DIR)", tool.slash, "tsconfig.json --pretty false 1>&2");
```
* In `generate` modify `compilerOptions` to include the needed `plugins` parameter as a new member: 
```tsc
[{ transform: tool.mainPath + "/node_modules/@cmidgley/di-transformer/src/transformer.ts" }],
```

Once done, you will need to rebuild the Moddable tools (in this case, for linux):

```
cd <path>/moddable/build/makefiles/lin
make
```

Don't forget to add this package to your `package.json` file, such as:

```
"dependencies": {
  "@cmidgley/di": "https://github.com/cmidgley/di"
}
```

# `@wessberg/di`

> A compile-time powered Dependency-Injection container for Typescript that holds services and can produce instances of them as required.

## Description

This is a tiny library that brings Dependency-Injection to Typescript. There are several competing libraries out there, but this one is unique in the sense
that:

- It is _seriously_ small.
- It does its work on compile-time. The only runtime dependency is the `DIContainer` itself.
- It doesn't ask you to reflect metadata or to annotate your classes with decorators. _"It just works"_.
- It maps interfaces to implementations. Most popular dependency injection systems for TypeScript doesn't do this. This allows you to truly decouple an abstraction from its implementation.
- It supports the .NET generic reflection flavour: `registerSingleton<Interface, Implementation>()`. No need for anything else.

This library provides constructor-based dependency injection. This means that your classes will receive dependency-injected services as arguments to their constructors.

This library is a runtime dependency, but you need to transform your code with the [`DI Custom Transformer`](https://github.com/wessberg/di-compiler) as part of your Typescript compilation step to make the reflection work.

## Install

### NPM

```
$ npm install @wessberg/di
```

### Yarn

```
$ yarn add @wessberg/di
```

## Usage

This library is meant to be super straightforward, super simple to use.
The following examples hopefully shows that:

### Registering services

To register services, simply instantiate a new service container and add services to it.
Here's several examples of how you may do that:

```typescript
import {DIContainer} from "@wessberg/di";

// Instantiate a new container for services
const container = new DIContainer();

// Register the service as a Singleton. Whenever the 'IMyService' service is requested,
// the same instance of MyService will be injected
container.registerSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();

// Register the service as a Transient. Whenever the 'IMyService' service is requested,
// a new instance of MyService will be injected
container.registerTransient<IMyOtherService, MyOtherService>();

// Rather than mapping a class to an interface,
// here we provide a function that returns an object that implements
// the required interface
container.registerSingleton<IAppConfig>(() => myAppConfig);

// You don't have to map an interface to an implementation.
container.registerSingleton<MyAwesomeService>();
```

### Retrieving instances of services

#### Injecting instances of services into classes

...Works completely automatically. As long as your class is constructed via
a `DIContainer`, and as long as the services it depends on are registered,
the class will receive the services as arguments to its' constructor:

```typescript
class MyClass {
  constructor(
    private myService: IMyService,
    private myOtherService: IMyOtherService,
    private myAwesomeService: MyAwesomeService
  ) {}
}
```

The true power of this library in comparison to others is that all of this mapping happens on compile-time.
This is what enables you to depend on interfaces, rather than objects that live on runtime.

#### Getting instances directly from the `DIContainer`

Sure, you can do that if you want to:

```typescript
// Gets a concrete instance of 'IMyService'. The implementation will
// depend on what you provided when you registered the service
const service = container.get<IMyService>();
```

## FAQ

#### This is pure magic. How does it work?

It may look like it, but I assure you it is quite simple. [Read this answer for an explanation](https://github.com/wessberg/di-compiler#how-does-it-work-exactly).

#### Is it possible to have multiple, scoped containers?

Sure. You can instantiate as many as you want to, as long as you make sure the [Custom Transformer for DI](https://github.com/wessberg/di-compiler) get's to see the files that contain them.
